Note: Connect your MetaMask wallet before using the app.

A decentralized system for securely storing and managing genomic data using blockchain and IPFS.
It combines encryption, decentralized storage, and smart contracts to ensure privacy and controlled access.

Features:
Encrypts genomic data before upload
Stores encrypted files on IPFS (via Pinata/NFT.Storage)
Manages access using Ethereum smart contracts
React-based frontend for easy interaction

Tech Stack:
Backend: Python, Solidity
Frontend: React.js, Web3.js
Storage: IPFS (Pinata / NFT.Storage)
Blockchain: Ethereum

How It Works:
Encrypts genomic data locally
Uploads encrypted data to IPFS
Stores CID on blockchain
Grants/revokes access via smart contract
